# Java Fundamentals and Object Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance. Main Concepts - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.

<tbody><tr><th>Comparison Index</th> <th>C++</th><th>Java</th></tr>
<tr><td>Platform-independent</td><td>C++ is platform-dependent.</td><td>Java is platform-independent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mainly used for</td><td>C++ is mainly used for system programming.</td><td>Java is mainly used for application programming. It is widely used in window, web-based, enterprise and mobile applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Goto</td><td>C++ supports goto statement.</td><td>Java doesn't support goto statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Multiple inheritance</td><td>C++ supports multiple inheritance.</td><td>Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can be achieved by interfaces in java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Operator Overloading</td><td>C++ supports operator overloading.</td><td>Java doesn't support operator overloading.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pointers</td><td>C++ supports pointers. You can write pointer program in C++.</td><td>Java supports pointer internally. But you can't write the pointer program in java. It means java has restricted pointer support in java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Compiler and Interpreter</td><td>C++ uses compiler only.</td><td>Java uses compiler and interpreter both.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Call by Value and Call by reference</td><td>C++ supports both call by value and call by reference.</td><td>Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Structure and Union</td><td>C++ supports structures and unions.</td><td>Java doesn't support structures and unions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thread Support</td><td>C++ doesn't have built-in support for threads. It relies on third-party libraries for thread support.</td><td>Java has built-in thread support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Documentation comment</td><td>C++ doesn't support documentation comment.</td><td>Java supports documentation comment (/** ... */) to create documentation for java source code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Virtual Keyword</td><td>C++ supports virtual keyword so that we can decide whether or not override a function.</td><td>Java has no virtual keyword. We can override all non-static methods by default. In other words, non-static methods are virtual by default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>unsigned right shift &gt;&gt;&gt;</td><td>C++ doesn't support &gt;&gt;&gt; operator.</td><td>Java supports unsigned right shift &gt;&gt;&gt; operator that fills zero at the top for the negative numbers. For positive numbers, it works same like &gt;&gt; operator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inheritance Tree</td><td>C++ creates a new inheritance tree always.</td><td>Java uses single inheritance tree always because all classes are the child of Object class in java. Object class is the root of inheritance tree in java.</td></tr>

## Methods of Object Class
The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default.
